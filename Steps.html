<h3>Your plan is to set out on the grand journey of becoming a successful screenwriter. The first thing you need to do is understand the career.

So what exactly does a screenwriter do?</h3><br>

<h3 style="background-color:"><center><Font face="Copperplate Gothic">SCREENWRITER DEFINITION</Font></center><br>
What does a screenwriter do?<br>
A screenwriter is someone who writes content for a visual medium. This could be for feature films, television, documentaries, commercials, video games, music videos, online content, and educational material.

A screenwriter is paid to write scripts, screenplays, teleplays, AV scripts, and treatments that include strong concepts, coherent themes, well structured plots, and dynamic characters.

The main thing to remember is that the world is changing, and while film and television writing is the standard for professional screenwriters, many signs point toward other avenues that still need good screenwriting skills.

That doesn’t mean movies are dead, or that you should stab out your eyes lest you see yet another writing credit that does not belong to you.

Don't give up… we’re just getting started.

<Font face="Copperplate Gothic">2. Study other screenplays</Font><br>
<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
The next thing you need to do is to read scripts. Study how your favorite screenwriters wrote your favorite produced scripts.

This is absolutely non-negotiable.

Watching movies will help you too, but screenwriting and directing are very different crafts, and while they are very much connected and inform one another, you have to start by hitting some balls off the tee.

<Font face="Copperplate Gothic">3. Read screenwriting books</Font><br>
<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
To be a good screenwriter, it helps to be a relentless reader. This doesn’t mean you can’t have success with a lot of ambition, life experience, and perspective — but at the very least you need to read screenwriting books.

But don’t pick one book and follow it as gospel — mix and match.

You wouldn’t watch only Tarantino films to learn how to become a director, or only watch Lebron James to become a basketball player.

The best screenwriters understand filmmaking in general, and while it takes a different skill set to be a screenwriter versus a director, you will only benefit from having a holistic approach to filmmaking.

<Font face="Copperplate Gothic">4. Learn screenwriting format</Font><br>
<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
This is a funny one. A lot of screenwriting guides have this step way too far down the list. I think this is a phenomenon unique to screenwriting.

No one tells you to start drilling for oil before you do a proper survey.

No one tells you to develop a prototype before you learn to code.

No one tells you to perform a few surgeries before you go to med school.
Screenplay formatting is relatively simple to learn. Once you understand the relationship between action lines, characters, dialogue, and scene headings you will have a much easier time writing your scripts.

What if you’re writing a music video, or a commercial, or some other form of screenwriting that will be hindered by narrative screenplay format? That’s when you use an AV script template.

What’s an AV script?

This is where you create a document with a table — two columns — one for your audio, and one for the corresponding video. Hence ‘AV’ script.

AV scripts can be used for YouTube videos, political ads, anything really.

If you have yet to decide on a professional screenwriting software, why not try out StudioBinder’s free screenplay and AV script feature.

Our software guides you through the writing process and displays helpful formatting icons at the top of the script. These buttons will help you apply the appropriate margin and alignment for each line of text.

What is standard screenplay format?
Screenplay format is relatively simple, but it’s one of those things that can seem a bit daunting until you’ve actually learned how to do it.

The basics of script formatting are as follows:<br>

1. 12-point Courier font size<br>
2. 1.5 inch margin on the left of the page<br>
3. 1 inch margin on the right of the page<br>
4. 1 inch on the of the top and bottom of the page<br>
5. Each page should have approximately 55 lines<br>
6. The dialogue block starts 2.5 inches from the left side of the page<br>
7. Character names must have uppercase letters and be positioned starting 3.7 inches from the left side of the page<br>
8. Page numbers are positioned in the top right corner with a 0.5 inch margin from the top of the page. The first page shall not be numbered, and each number is followed by a period.<br>

<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
SCRIPT REGISTRATION AT SWA (OFFLINE AND ONLINE)
The Screenwriters Association registers, through its office & website – scripts, lyrics and stories written by its members. SWA’s Script registration can act as a proof of authorship of the copyright work and can be used as Prima facie evidence in case the copyright authorship is challenged by the date of registration.

<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
How to Write a Movie Synopsis
Before diving into the content of your synopsis, it's helpful to get familiar with the general synopsis formatting guidelines.

Write a header. At the top of the synopsis, include your script's title, your name, and your contact information. This is so the recipient can reach you in the event that they receive the synopsis from someone else.
Write a logline. Include your logline before your first paragraph to give the reader a sense of where the story is going.
Summarize your screenplay. Write in the third person in present tense (e.g., "Sarah jumps out of the plane”). If your screenplay follows the traditional three-act structure, splitting your synopsis into three paragraphs—one for each act—is an easy way to summarize your story. This isn't a steadfast rule, so if one paragraph is significantly longer than the rest, feel free to split it up.
Keep it short. A one-page synopsis is standard for an average-length screenplay. One page only takes a few minutes to read and is enough for the reader to tell if the material speaks to them.

<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
<h3><center>Get an Agent</center></h3>
We get it; you want your script to fall into the hands of as many producers as possible.  But sending unsolicited emails with your manuscript is the fastest route to the trash bin.

Producers receive a lot of scripts. Most studios will not accept unsolicited screenplays or even have a way to submit them. Your best bet is to get yourself some kind of representation.

A literary agent will have all the right hookups to get your screenplay into the hands of the Hollywood shot-callers. An agent won’t guarantee your script gets produced, but they’ll boost your status and make your script known around town.

Another potential option is to start writing in a separate field and work your way into Hollywood.

Often, first-time screenwriters are not plucked from obscurity but come into the industry from writing novels, plays, or pieces for magazines. A literary agent will also help you in these endeavors.

It’s a hit to your confidence, but you kind of need to be a known quantity before Hollywood will be willing to look your way. Having your name attached to a best selling novel or in contention for a Tony will definitely boost your signal.

<h3><center>Submit to the Black List</center></h3>
This is an option only for those serious about getting their scripts into the hands of producers as it costs a fair chunk of change to do.

The Black List is an annual survey of unproduced screenplays that are highly regarded by Hollywood executives. Getting on the Black List astronomically improves your scripts chances of being discovered.

As of 2005 when the Black List survey was first conducted, 400 of the screenplays on the Black List have been produced. And since Hollywood only puts out about 300 films a year, that’s a pretty good success rate.

Black List screenplays also have a proven track record of bringing home the gold. Of the last 10 best picture winners, four have been Black List finalists.

The Black List currently has an online community where writers can submit and host their scripts to be read, professionally critiqued, and even acquired if they pique someone’s interest.

However, submitting and keeping your script on the Black List’s site does cost money.  Non-guild members will pay a $30 monthly fee per script kept on the site. For $75, you can get an evaluation from a professional reader.

The evaluations are the most useful part of the Black List. Critics will thoroughly read your script and give you notes on its feature film potential. This criticism will help you determine if screenplay writing is the right field for you.

<h3><center>Meet Some Producers</center></h3>
An often overlooked first step in getting your movie script in the hands of the right people is actually knowing the right people. Film festivals are the closest thing the film industry has to a career fair.

If you have a script completed, attend a film festival and see if you can rub elbows with some of the directors, producers, or even actors of the films being shown. Give them a brief summary of your film and have your contact information ready.

Do not, under any circumstance, shove a printed copy of your screenplay into a producer’s hands. That will only get you hauled off by security. Be likable and have a pitch that will interest people.

<Font face="Copperplate Gothic">9.Pitch your script</Font><br>
<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
<h3><center>What Is a Movie Pitch?</center></h3>
A movie pitch is when a screenwriter presents an idea for a feature film to people who can help finance or produce it, in hopes of securing money to write the first draft. The pitch process is meant to intrigue the people who can help make a movie—either studio executives, distributors, producers, or directors—to sign onto the project. A movie pitch can be a verbal or a visual presentation of a writer’s big idea, usually preceding the writing of a draft of the film. Film pitches are useful tools that briefly convey the important elements of a film project, like premise, characters, plot, and budget.
<h3><center>Types of Pitches: Standard Pitch vs. Elevator Pitch</Center></h3>
There are two main forms your pitch meeting may take, depending on the amount of time you have with your audience.

The standard pitch: The standard pitch is a rehearsed, scheduled pitch in which the screenwriter relays their movie idea to a group of investors or production executives. In some cases, the execs may ask the creator to make a pitch deck to accompany their verbal presentation to help expand upon the screenwriter’s vision for the fim. These pitches often last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.
The elevator pitch: An elevator pitch is a much briefer form of the standard pitch. The idea is that you deliver the pitch quickly—in about the amount of time you would spend in an elevator ride. An effective elevator pitch should express the essential premise of the idea that doesn’t last more than 20 to 30 seconds.
<h3><center>How to Write a Movie Pitch</center></h3>
When you compile a movie pitch, you’ll want to include the most essential elements of your story or production in a clear and compelling way. For how to write a movie pitch, see the steps below.

Write an introduction. Start your movie pitch with a brief overview of the film, which should include the title, logline, genre, and theme of the project. Address whether your story is entirely fiction, or based on a true story. In some cases, you may want to include why this particular screenplay is important, and what it means to you.
Include a synopsis. Whether you’re presenting with a deck or verbally, include a section that summarizes the premise of your film. Discuss the basic plot of the story without giving away the whole story.
Discuss the characters. Include a section in your pitch that breaks down your main characters. Describe the protagonist, any antagonists, or important secondary characters that are essential to the plot. Briefly discuss their motivations, arcs, or significant traits that make these characters compelling.
Address the filmmaking elements. Your movie pitch may include specific types of cinematography, styles, lighting, or music that inspire you or add to the mood of your film. Include any unique elements of the filmmaking that may bolster your chances of a successful pitch. Mention the budget, existing financing, or if any directors or actors are currently attached.
Write a compelling conclusion. Conclude your pitch by discussing how the story ends. You can also end on a cliffhanger, but make sure it leaves the listeners wanting more, rather than confusing them or leaving them unsatisfied. You can also discuss the significance of making your film at this very moment, and any other interesting personal elements that could help sell your idea. You want to convince your audience that you are the only one who can make this movie.
