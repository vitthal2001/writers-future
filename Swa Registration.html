<Font face="Copperplate Gothic">WHAT IS ‘SCRIPT REGISTRATION’?</Font><br>
<p><Font face="Segoe Print">
Registering your literary and dramatic work like story, screenplay, script, etc. (Work) with Screenwriters Association (SWA) means creating a public record of the Work. Further, this registration is prima facie evidence of your authorship. For example, if two people have registered the identical story on different dates. Subsequently, a dispute arises regarding the real author of this story. The adjudicating authority shall first look into the date of the registration. The person who has registered first shall be considered as prima facie author and, the burden of proof shall shift to another party who denies the same. Let’s assume another scenario to understand the benefit of the registration. Mr. A released a film on 5th October 2020. Mr. B released another film with a similar storyline year 1st January 2021. Now, Mr. A sues Mr. B for copyright infringement. Mr. B can defend himself if he proves that he has registered the script of his film before 5th October 2020. Act of registration shows that the Writer is the prima facie author of the work. It is the reason why most of the production houses/platforms accept only registered work to consider. Apart from legal protection, SWA registration is widely accepted in the industry. Sending a registered work through a proper channel appears more professional than randomly sharing your unregistered work.
